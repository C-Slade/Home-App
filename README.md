# Home-App
This app allows you to create links and set their links to go wherever you want.

You first get prompt two input boxes asking your name and location, and it starts.
You can also create widgets that go more into detail about your weather (humidity, visibility, etc..). There are two options: Same Location, and change to 
a new location. So you can create as many widgets to wherever you want to see the weather of that location.

When typing in your location, you are able to enter the city/state/country to veiw the weather.
